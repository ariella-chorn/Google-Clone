# Google Clone Project 

## Overview 
This repository contains a Google homepage clone that I created as my first hands-on project after spending considerable time on coding challenges and tutorials. The primary objective was to delve into practical coding by building a responsive website, prioritizing mobile-friendliness.

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was not to create a functional Google clone but to gain practical experience and apply the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS. The focus was on making the website responsive, particularly prioritizing mobile devices.

## Key Learnings 
### 1. HTML Fundamentals 
- Recognizing the parallels between HTML tags and organizing concepts in word processing software.
- Understanding how labeling in HTML (title, header, text) mirrors creating an organized document.

### 2. CSS Fundamentals
- Gaining insights into the basics of CSS.
- Adding and styling buttons for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky."
- Implementing hover effects on buttons and the search bar.
- Incorporating different font styles for text enhancement.
- Integrating icons around the search bar.
- Utilizing @media queries to adapt the layout based on screen width.

## Reflection 
This project served as a solid foundation for understanding HTML and CSS. The experience not only enhanced my knowledge of building responsive websites but also sparked curiosity and motivation to explore the more advanced and creative aspects of web development.
